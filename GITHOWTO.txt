  How to access the git server:


1. Install git from
   https://git-scm.com

2. Start a git-bash-shell

3. Create a directory named .ssh in your home directory:

cd
mkdir .ssh

4.  Copy the file config from this github page to the .ssh directory.
Edit the file, insert your usernaem to the appropriate place

5. generate a key:

cd .ssh
ssh-keygen -f USERNAME

This will create two files in .ssh, USERNAME and USERNAME.pub, where
USERNAME is your favourite user name.

6. Send the file USERNAME.pub to me.

7. Once, I installed your key, check if it works:

ssh gitt-pte


8. Move to a directory dedicated to this class. For example:

mkdir logic25
cd logic25

9. Initialize your repositories (You can write a fake email address,
if you want to hide it from the other students.):

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.address"

git clone gitt-pte:logic25/bodri
git clone gitt-pte:logic25/USERNAME
git clone gitt-pte:logic25/common
